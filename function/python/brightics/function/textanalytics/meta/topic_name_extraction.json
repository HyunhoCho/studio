    "description": "This function suggests some topic names based on the topic vocabularies. It takes an output topic table from topic modeling functions, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or GSDMM, as the input table. Additionally, either (1) an output model from the Word2Vec function as an input model or (2) a similarity matrix for words as an input table is needed. For the former case, note that both Word2vec and the topic modeling function should have the same input documents, and for the latter case, the first column (the column names, resp.) should contain the words as indices of rows. (columns, resp.) The output table has five additional columns, each of which is derived from distinct weighting options. The first column uses the weights as given in the topic table, the second uses harmonic weights [1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...], the third uses geometric weights [1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...], the fourth uses log weights [log(N), log(N-1), log(N-2), ...] where N is the number of topic words, and the fifth uses constant weights [1, 1, 1, ...].",
